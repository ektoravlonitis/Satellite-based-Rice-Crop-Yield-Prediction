# Rice Crop Yield Estimation Using Satellite Data

### Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to estimate rice crop yield using satellite data in the An Giang province of Vietnam. The primary objective of this study was to leverage the European Copernicus (Sentinel-1) program and NASA's Landsat program to track the location and growth of rice crops, and subsequently predict their productivity. By integrating satellite data, weather data, and advanced analytics, we aimed to achieve a deeper understanding of rice crop phenology and provide essential information for agricultural decision-making, resource allocation, and policy formulation.
